# For acquisition functions
    - Check dimentionality and see how to make it robust
    - Check alternative formualtion regarding sigma and such. How have people implemented it robustly
    - Gradients?

# For Bayesian optimization
    - Understand how to structure the objective function and f thing
    - Write the next point loop
    - Write a main run loop that executes the bayesian optimization

# For my own
    - Implement special version of EI
    - Add dimension checks in GPmodel class
    - Think about the equivalent of mu_opt for composit case!!
